				<p class="lead">I am an interdisciplinary researcher, working on both problems related to mathematical physics, topological solitons, integrable systems, algebraic geometry, and cancer statistics. Here are a sample of the topics I have previously or am currently working on.</p><br>
				<h4>
					Current Research Interests:
				</h4>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        <b>Monopoles</b> <br>
                                        Euclidean and hyperbolic monopoles are important both from a phenomenological perspective, and as a lense through which to study integrable gauge theories via geometrical methods and twistor constructions. I am working on an ongoing project to unify these perspectives and connect them to the construction of explicit monpole solutions. This often involves looking for symmetric solutions. Moreover, I am interested in the moduli spaces of these monopoles and which geometric structures on them exist. <a href="https://disneyhogg.github.io/personal_webpage/monopolefigurethreed.html">See an example here.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Integrability of Classical Hamiltonian Systems</b> <br>
					It is very classical and difficult question to ask which Hamiltonian systems are integrable, and why. I am working to develop modern computational techniques to identify avatars of integrability, and hopefully use these to elucidate how to construct the involutive quantities required for proof. Theoretically, I am interested in which manifolds give rise to integrable geodesic Hamiltonians. As part of this I am studying Riemann surfaces, as the spectral curve is a power tool in understanding systems which posess a Lax pair. 

				<p>
					<b>Cancer Science </b> <br>
          I have writen papers on using Mendelian randomisation for causal inference with respect to cancers, and on Hi-C methodologies and their underlying algorithmic implementations. I am further interested in other mathematical aspects of cancer science, such as applications of machine learning and topological data analysis techniques for elucidating strucure. 
				<!-- Hi-C methodologies offer the opportunity to understand the 3d shape of DNA, which is typically read as a linear sequence of bases. I am interested in how models developed to analyse this data perform, and in the development of tools using modern mathematical techniques which hold the potential to provide alternative viewpoints.  -->

                                <p>
                                        <b>Computational Algebraic Geometry </b> <br>
                                   Given the presence of Riemann surfaces and related objects in the construction of solutions to integrable systems, I am interested in what we can achieve numerically, either in finding these solutions or understanding the symmetry of these surfaces. To do this I largely use SageMath, in which I have implemented a method for the calculation of the Abel-Jacobi map, also available  <a href = https://github.com/DisneyHogg/Abel-Jacobi-in-SageMath>from a Github repo</a>. I also use GAP, Macaulay2, Maple, and Python. Moreover, I have begun to experiment with methods for using machine learning to glean insight into complex algebrogeometric behaiour, such as the orbits of theta characteristics.
